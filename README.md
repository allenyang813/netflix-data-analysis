# Netflix Movies & TV Shows – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores the Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset using Python to understand content distribution, ratings, genres, and release trends on the platform.  
The analysis focuses on data cleaning, aggregation, and visualisation to uncover high-level patterns in Netflix’s catalogue.

## Dataset
- Source: Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset (public dataset)
- Records: Movies and TV shows available on Netflix
- Key fields: type, title, country, rating, release_year, date_added, listed_in

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Workflow
1. Cleaned and prepared the dataset (handled missing values, standardised columns, converted dates).
2. Explored content distribution by type (Movies vs TV Shows).
3. Analysed ratings across content types.
4. Grouped and aggregated titles by release year and genre.
5. Visualised trends using bar charts and line graphs.
6. Summarised insights in a conclusion section.

## Key Insights
- Movies make up the majority of Netflix’s catalogue.
- TV shows have increased steadily in recent years.
- Certain genres dominate the platform’s content offering.
- Content additions peaked in specific years, showing growth trends.
